    title: "docs(project): align README, memory-bank, and GH issues to Ball Lightning AB"
    details: |-
      - Rewrote README.md for Ball Lightning AB company site (removed all TBC boilerplate content)
      - Updated memory-bank-usage.yaml: replaced all The Builder Coil / pdd-thebuildercoil.yaml references with Ball Lightning AB / balllightning-pdd.yaml; corrected GitHub project URL to projects/9; updated commit message examples
      - Updated active-context.yaml: moved Issue #3 (asset assembly) to current with full structured deliverables (I3D1–I3D11); expanded next_steps with structured Issue #2 entry (I2D1–I2D8) incl. Chronomation; fixed malformed YAML quote on issue URL
      - Updated GitHub Issue #2: added Chronomation as 5th portfolio subpage (architecture, AI pipeline, multi-tenant), updated file structure, acceptance criteria, estimated effort
      - Updated GitHub Issue #3: applied 2026 best-practice review — logo ≠ favicon distinction; corrected manifest to site.webmanifest with full spec (id, start_url, scope, purpose fields); corrected theme_color to #05070A; clarified three distinct asset sets (logo / favicons / app icons); added head tag implementation notes and favicon caching warning
      - FUNDING.yml, LICENSE, TRADEMARKS.md verified correct for Ball Lightning AB — no changes needed
