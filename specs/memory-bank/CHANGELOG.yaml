    title: "fix: resolve i18n redirect loop and add contribution graph translations"
    details: |-
      - Fixed redirect loop in Paraglide middleware by using correct request pattern
      - Updated server.ts to use original request instead of modified request from callback
      - Confirmed fix working - localhost:3000 redirects to /en (307), /en loads successfully (200)
      - Added full GitHub contribution graph translations (activity period, less/more labels)
      - Enhanced ContributionGraphLegend component to accept custom translation props
      - Added translation keys for contribution graph in all 4 locales (en, sv, de, fr)
      - Updated services to reference MCP (Model Context Protocol) instead of GraphQL
      - All 108 translation keys now consistent across all locales
      - Updated biome.json to ignore generated paraglide files and archived specs

    commit: 346c5cb
    status: troubleshooting
    title: "chore: bump version to 0.2 for i18n troubleshooting"
    details: |-
      - Updated meta release version to 0.2 for language switching implementation
      - Updated issue #4 status to "troubleshooting" due to redirect loop (ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS)
      - Site correctly redirects localhost:3000 to localhost:3000/en but creates infinite loop
      - Basic i18n infrastructure appears to be in place from previous implementation
      - Need to debug middleware/routing configuration causing infinite redirects
      
      Implementation Summary:
      - Paraglide JS v2 fully configured with always-prefixed URL strategy (url → cookie → preferredLanguage → baseLocale)
      - vite.config.ts: paraglideVitePlugin with urlPatterns for / and /:path(.*)? across en/sv/de/fr
      - server.ts: paraglideMiddleware wrapped around TanStack Start handler
      - router.tsx: rewrite with deLocalizeUrl/localizeUrl for proper locale handling
      - Language switcher component: desktop Select + mobile buttons with flag icons
      - 105 translation keys created for all 4 locales (en, sv, de, fr) in messages/
      - All routes updated to import and use messages: `import * as m from "@/paraglide/messages.js"`
      - Sitemap generator updated with hreflang links for all locales
      - i18n-check.ts script validates missing keys and placeholder parity
      - package.json: added "i18n:check" and "machine-translate" scripts
      
      Deliverables Status:
      - I4D1-I4D3: In progress (routing validation, SSR loading, language switching)
      - I4D4-I4D14: Complete (QA checks, Paraglide setup, components, translations)
