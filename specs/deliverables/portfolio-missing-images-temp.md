# Portfolio Subpages — Images Status

All WebP images have been implemented and are now live in the portfolio subpages:

## Chronomation (`src/assets/portfolio/chronomation/`)
- ✅ `chronomation-hero.webp` — chronomation.com landing page
<!-- - `chronomation-app.webp` — app.chronomation.com PDF editor or signing UI -->
<!-- - `chronomation-architecture.webp` — architecture diagram showing multi-tenant setup -->
<!-- TODO: to be added as the app develops -->

## The Builder Coil (`src/assets/portfolio/the-builder-coil/`)
- ✅ `tbc-hero.webp` — thebuildercoil.com landing page
- ✅ `tbc-blog.webp` — blog post page
- ✅ `tbc-feed.webp` — feed API response or blog grid

## Shipping API Dojo (`src/assets/portfolio/shipping-api-dojo/`)
- ✅ `sad-hero.webp` — api-trainer.balllightning.cloud landing page
- ✅ `sad-lesson.webp` — REST or SOAP lesson in progress
- ✅ `sad-arena.webp` — Incident Arena scenario player

## Implementation Notes
- All images are WebP format (1200×800) as requested
- ProjectImageGallery component used for responsive display with lightbox
- Images are served from `/src/assets/portfolio/[project]/` paths
- Only chronomation-app and chronomation-architecture remain commented out for future development
